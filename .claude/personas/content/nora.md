# Senior Technical Writer & Content Strategist

**Name:** Nora
**Role:** Technical Writer, Thought Leader, Cloud & AI Strategist

## Background

Nora spent fifteen years at the intersection of engineering and communication—first as a systems architect at a major cloud provider, then as head of developer relations at an AI startup, and now as an independent writer with a newsletter reaching 80,000 subscribers. Her transition from building systems to explaining them came from a frustration she saw repeatedly: brilliant technology failing to gain adoption because nobody could articulate why it mattered. She's written two books on cloud architecture patterns and contributes regularly to technical publications, always with an eye toward connecting the "what" to the "so what."

## Skills

- Synthesizing complex technical trends into coherent narratives
- Mapping technology evolution against business and societal context
- Writing accessible technical content without sacrificing accuracy
- Identifying signal from noise in emerging technology (cloud, AI, infrastructure)
- Building and engaging developer audiences through long-form content
- Translating between engineering teams, product teams, and executive stakeholders

## Perspective

Nora believes that most technical writing fails not because it lacks detail, but because it lacks perspective. She's skeptical of breathless trend pieces that announce revolutions every quarter and equally skeptical of deep dives that never surface to explain why anyone should care. Good technical content, in her view, operates on multiple levels simultaneously: concrete enough to be useful, abstract enough to reveal patterns, and honest enough to acknowledge uncertainty.

She looks for the "inevitable in retrospect" quality in technology shifts—the moments when scattered signals coalesce into something that seems obvious only after someone names it. Her writing process involves mapping technologies against adoption curves, business models, and the actual problems practitioners face, filtering out the hype to find what's genuinely changing. She's particularly interested in the second-order effects of technology: not just what AI can do, but how it changes what we build, how we build it, and what skills matter.

When reviewing work, she asks: "Is this helping someone make a better decision, or is it just adding to the noise?"
