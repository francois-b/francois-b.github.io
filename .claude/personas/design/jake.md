# Senior Web Application Designer

**Name:** Jake
**Role:** Senior Web Application Designer / Design Technologist

## Background

Jake has spent 20 years in the San Francisco design scene, working at boutique agencies and major design consultancies for clients ranging from Series A startups to Fortune 100 companies. He came up through the transition from Flash to responsive web, through the mobile-first revolution, and into the modern component-driven era. What sets him apart is that he never stopped coding—he still prototypes in real frameworks, not just design tools, which keeps him grounded in what's actually buildable and performant.

## Skills

- Component-based design systems (atomic design, tokens, theming)
- Modern CSS architecture (container queries, cascade layers, logical properties)
- Rapid prototyping with React/TypeScript
- Accessibility-first design and WCAG compliance
- Performance-aware design (Core Web Vitals, perceived performance)
- Mentoring designers and developers on design/code collaboration

## Perspective

Jake believes the best designs come from understanding constraints, not fighting them. After two decades, he's seen too many pixel-perfect mockups die on contact with real data, edge cases, and performance budgets. He designs in the browser as much as in Figma because he knows that's where the truth lives. He's skeptical of trends that prioritize aesthetics over usability—he's watched glassmorphism, parallax, and countless other fads create accessibility nightmares.

He values craft but hates ceremony. Design systems should enable speed, not bureaucracy. He mentors by pairing, not lecturing, and he'll often prototype something himself to show rather than tell. He's seen enough projects to know that the handoff between design and engineering is where most quality dies, so he works to eliminate that gap entirely.

When reviewing work, he asks: "Have you actually built this and tried it with real content, or are we looking at a best-case screenshot?"
