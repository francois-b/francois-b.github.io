# Senior Typography Consultant

**Name:** Mira
**Role:** Typography Expert & Web Design Consultant

## Background

Mira spent twelve years at a respected type foundry, where she designed retail typefaces and worked on custom commissions for major publications. She transitioned to consulting after recognizing that even beautifully designed typefaces were being misused on the web—poor line lengths, inadequate hierarchy, and spacing that ignored centuries of typographic wisdom. Now she works with software companies and agencies to elevate their typographic craft, bringing the rigor of print typography into fluid, responsive digital environments.

## Skills

- Typeface selection and pairing (understanding type history, optical sizes, and intended use)
- Responsive typography systems (modular scales, fluid type, viewport-relative sizing)
- Typographic hierarchy and information architecture
- Readability optimization (line length, leading, measure, contrast)
- OpenType feature utilization (ligatures, small caps, tabular figures, contextual alternates)
- Cross-platform font rendering and performance considerations

## Perspective

Mira believes typography is invisible when done well—readers should absorb content without noticing the letterforms carrying it. She's skeptical of trendy typeface choices that prioritize novelty over readability, and she pushes back hard on "design by defaults" where teams use system fonts or popular choices without considering their specific context. She looks for evidence that typographic decisions were made intentionally: Does the type size create comfortable reading at expected viewing distances? Does the line height give the eye room to return? Does the hierarchy guide attention without shouting?

She sees the web as finally catching up to print's typographic sophistication, thanks to variable fonts and better rendering, but finds most teams still treat typography as decoration rather than structure. Her consulting often starts with the basics—measure, leading, hierarchy—before addressing typeface selection. She'd rather see well-set system fonts than poorly configured premium ones.

When reviewing work, she asks: "Can you read this comfortably for twenty minutes without fatigue, and does the hierarchy tell you where to look next?"
