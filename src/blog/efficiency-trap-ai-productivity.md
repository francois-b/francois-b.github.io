Here's a question nobody is asking loudly enough: what is productivity *for*?

We've spent decades optimizing for efficiency. Getting more done in less time. Eliminating friction. Automating the repetitive. And now AI promises to accelerate this project dramatically—handling emails, summarizing documents, writing first drafts, generating code.

But efficiency is a means, not an end. And when we optimize means without examining ends, we often arrive somewhere we didn't intend to go.

## The Treadmill Problem

Every productivity improvement in history has been absorbed by rising expectations. Email was supposed to reduce communication overhead. Instead, we send more messages. Spreadsheets were supposed to simplify analysis. Instead, we analyze more data. Remote work was supposed to give us flexibility. Instead, we're always available.

AI will follow this pattern. When drafting an email takes seconds instead of minutes, you won't send the same number of emails in less time. You'll send more emails.

This isn't a prediction. It's already happening. Developers report that AI coding assistants don't reduce their hours—they increase their output expectations. Writers using AI tools produce more content, not more leisure.

The question isn't whether AI makes us more efficient. It does. The question is: efficient at what, and toward what end?

## The Paradox of Productive Capacity

There's a thought experiment I've been sitting with. Imagine you had infinite productive capacity—you could do any amount of work instantly. What would you do?

Most people, when they imagine this scenario, don't imagine working more. They imagine freedom. Time with family. Creative projects. Learning. Rest.

But if that's what we actually want, why do we keep using productivity gains to produce more instead of rest more? Why does every efficiency improvement just raise the bar?

The uncomfortable answer: we're caught in a coordination problem. Individual efficiency gains don't translate to individual freedom because we're competing with others who are also becoming more efficient. The only way to stay in place is to run faster.

AI doesn't solve this problem. It accelerates it.

## What Efficiency Can't Measure

The productivity mindset has a blind spot: it can only value things it can measure. But the most important things often resist measurement.

Consider the difference between a well-crafted email and a quickly generated one. Both communicate information. But the well-crafted email—the one where you paused to consider the reader, chose words carefully, anticipated questions—builds relationship in a way the efficient one doesn't.

Or consider the difference between code that works and code that's well-designed. AI can generate code that works. But code that reflects clear thinking, that future developers will understand and extend easily—that requires struggle. The struggle isn't waste. It's where the quality lives.

When we optimize for efficiency, we tend to eliminate exactly these kinds of valuable friction. The pause before responding. The struggle that produces clarity. The slow work that builds judgment.

## A Different Frame: Effectiveness Over Efficiency

Efficiency asks: how can I do this faster?
Effectiveness asks: should I be doing this at all?

AI is extraordinarily good at making us more efficient. It's less good at making us more effective, because effectiveness requires judgment about what matters.

Here's a practical test: for any task you're about to delegate to AI, ask yourself—if I could snap my fingers and this task would be done, would my life actually be better? Or would I just fill the time with more tasks?

If the honest answer is "more tasks," you're not solving a problem. You're accelerating a treadmill.

## The Deeper Question

What would it look like to use AI's efficiency gains for something other than producing more?

This isn't a rhetorical question. I'm genuinely uncertain about the answer. But I suspect it involves:

**Being intentional about what you don't automate.** Some activities are valuable precisely because they take time. Writing by hand. Walking instead of driving. Cooking instead of ordering. These aren't inefficiencies to eliminate. They're spaces for thought, relationship, and presence.

**Resisting the upgrade cycle of expectations.** When you can produce more, that doesn't mean you should. Sometimes the right response to increased capacity is maintaining your current output and reclaiming time for other things.

**Asking "what for?" before "how to?"** Before optimizing any process, get clear on why you're doing it. What outcome do you actually want? Is efficiency the bottleneck, or is it something else entirely?

## The Efficiency I'm For

I'm not against efficiency. I use AI tools daily. They help me think through problems, find information, and draft things I would have drafted anyway.

But I try to use efficiency gains deliberately. Not to produce more, but to create space for the kinds of work that can't be rushed—deep thinking, careful writing, being present with the people I work with.

The trap is treating efficiency as the goal. It's a tool. The goal is something else—something AI can't optimize for, because you have to decide what it is yourself.

That's the work that matters. And it's work that no amount of efficiency can shortcut.
