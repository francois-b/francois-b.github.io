The self-improvement industry is built on a simple premise: you can become better through effort. Read more, practice deliberately, build habits, and you'll grow. The struggle is the path.

AI complicates this narrative. If an AI can write better than you'll ever write, what's the point of learning to write? If AI can code fluently in every language, why spend years mastering one? If AI can analyze data, synthesize research, and generate insights, where does human growth fit in?

These aren't hypothetical questions. They're reshaping how people think about learning and development. And the answers matter.

## The Old Model of Growth

The traditional model of personal growth went something like this:

1. Identify a skill you lack
2. Practice it through effort and repetition
3. Develop competence over time
4. Apply that competence to achieve goals

The model assumed a stable relationship between effort and capability. Put in the hours, and you'll get better. Get better, and you'll be able to do more.

This model still works for many things. Physical fitness doesn't care about AI. Neither do relationships, or emotional regulation, or the ability to be present. But for cognitive skills—the ones knowledge workers care most about—the model is being disrupted.

## The New Landscape

In the new landscape, the effort-to-capability relationship is no longer straightforward.

**You can access capabilities without building them.** Want to write a business proposal? AI can help, even if you can't write well yourself. Want to analyze a dataset? Same. The capability is available on demand, no development required.

**The baseline keeps rising.** When everyone has access to AI assistance, having AI assistance isn't an advantage. The question becomes: what can you do that AI-assisted everyone can't?

**Skill value is decoupling from skill effort.** Some skills took years to develop but are now AI-augmentable. Others still require human development. The market is repricing accordingly.

This doesn't mean growth is obsolete. It means we need to think more carefully about *what* we're growing and *why*.

## Three Frameworks for Growth in the AI Age

### Framework 1: Grow What AI Can't Provide

Some capabilities remain stubbornly human. These are where growth investments have the highest long-term returns.

**Judgment.** AI can provide options and analysis. It can't decide what matters to you, what risks are acceptable, what trade-offs align with your values. Developing judgment requires making decisions and living with consequences—something you can't delegate.

**Relationships.** Trust is built through consistency, vulnerability, and presence. These can't be automated. The ability to connect with others, to lead, to collaborate—these remain human capacities that compound with development.

**Taste.** Knowing what's good—in design, in writing, in solutions—is a form of expertise that AI can't replicate because it doesn't have preferences. Developing taste requires exposure, reflection, and accumulated experience.

**Physical and emotional skills.** Playing music, athletic ability, emotional regulation, mindfulness—these develop through embodied practice that AI can't shortcut.

### Framework 2: Grow Your Ability to Direct AI

If AI is increasingly capable, the ability to direct that capability becomes more valuable.

This means developing:

**Clear thinking.** AI responds to prompts. Better prompts produce better results. Better prompts come from clear thinking about what you actually need.

**Domain expertise.** The person who deeply understands a domain can use AI far more effectively than someone who doesn't. They know what questions to ask, can evaluate the answers, and can integrate AI output with context the AI lacks.

**Systems thinking.** Understanding how pieces fit together, how changes propagate, what second-order effects might emerge—this enables directing AI toward solutions that work in the real world, not just in isolation.

### Framework 3: Grow Yourself, Not Just Your Capabilities

Here's a perspective that's harder to articulate but might be the most important.

Growth has value beyond instrumental capability. Learning something difficult changes you. Struggling with a problem, even inefficiently, develops cognitive capacities that aren't captured by the specific skill learned.

When I learned to program, I didn't just acquire the ability to write code. I developed a way of thinking—decomposing problems, debugging systematically, managing complexity. Those meta-skills transfer far beyond programming.

If I had access to perfect AI coding assistance from the start, I might produce the same outputs. But would I have developed the same cognitive patterns? Probably not.

There's an argument for growing skills even when AI could handle them, because the growth itself is valuable. The discipline of deliberate practice. The resilience built through struggle. The confidence that comes from genuine competence.

These aren't instrumentally valuable—or rather, their instrumental value is hard to specify. But they might be constitutive of the kind of person you want to become.

## The Question of Meaning

Here's the deeper question that haunts discussions of AI and growth: does capability without effort carry the same meaning?

Consider a mountain climber who reaches the summit through months of training and a difficult ascent. Now imagine someone airlifted to the same summit. They see the same view, technically achieve the same outcome. But something is different.

The difference is in what the achievement means to the person. The climber's summit is constituted by the journey. The airlifted visitor's summit is just a location.

When AI handles cognitive work, are we more like the climber using better gear, or more like the airlifted visitor? The answer depends on how much we engage with the process, how much we struggle, how much we grow along the way.

I don't think there's a universal answer. But the question is worth asking every time we consider outsourcing cognitive work: what meaning am I giving up? Is that trade-off worth it?

## A Practical Approach

If I were advising someone on personal development in the AI age, I'd suggest:

1. **Be intentional about what you're developing.** Not all skills are equal. Focus on capabilities that remain distinctly human, that enable directing AI, or that contribute to who you want to become.

2. **Use AI as a lever, not a replacement for growth.** Let AI handle what's genuinely tedious. But don't let it bypass the struggles that develop you.

3. **Protect time for unassisted thinking.** The mind develops through exercise. Make sure you're still exercising it, even when assistance is available.

4. **Develop taste through exposure.** See excellent work in many domains. The ability to recognize quality is increasingly valuable and can only be developed through experience.

5. **Invest in relationships.** The most AI-proof investment is in other people. And the returns compound in ways that capabilities don't.

Growth remains possible—even essential. But the *what* and *why* of growth need more examination than they used to. AI doesn't eliminate the path of personal development. It just forces us to think harder about where we're trying to go.
